				  <p>Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (born 15 June 1992), also known as Mo Salah, 
					is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool 
					and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players of his generation and 
					amongst the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, 
					dribbling and speed.</p>
				  <p>Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, 
					where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 
					million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him 
					permanently for €15 million. In the 2016-17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful 
					title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists.</p>
				  <p>Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané after the departure 
					of Philippe Coutinho, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and 
					Premier League title successes the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup and 
					the League Cup. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' 
					Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the 
					Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, and finished third for the Best FIFA Men's 
					Player in 2018 and 2021. He received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for his winning strike in the 
					first Merseyside derby of the 2017-18 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's Premier League 
					top goalscorer, surpassing Robbie Fowler.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-md-12">
					<p>Outside of football, Salah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his 
						achievements[21][22] and was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential 
						people in 2019.[23] Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among 
						Egyptians.</p>

							  <p>Al Mokawloon<br>
								2006-10: Youth teams<br>
								Salah started out playing for the youth setups of local teams Ittihad Basyoun and Othmason Tanta.[26] He names Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti as his childhood idols.[27] In 2006, he joined the youth team of Al Mokawloon aged 14 after being spotted by a scout who had originally come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.[28][29] Salah frequently had to miss school to make the 3 hour journey to training.[27] When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the senior squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age</p>

								<p>2010-12: Senior team appearances<br>
									Salah made his senior team debut in the Egyptian Premier League coming on as a substitute on 3 May 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against El Mansoura. During the 2010–11 season Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.[28] Even though he was getting regular game time, Salah struggled to score. In the dressing room after matches he would sometimes be in tears because of this, and Radwan says it only motivated him to become better.[29] He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against Al Ahly.[31] He remained a regular for Al Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011–12 season.[32][33] Following the Port Said Stadium riot on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March 2012, the Egyptian Football Association announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.</p>
								<p>Basel<br>
									2012-13: Development and breakthrough<br>
									Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time,[35] so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt U-23 team.[36] The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.[37] Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.[38][39][40] He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for fan-favourite Xherdan Shaqiri (whom he would later play alongside at Liverpool).[41] Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against Steaua București during a friendly match, a 4–2 defeat.[42] He made his official Basel debut in a UEFA Champions League preliminary stage match against the Norwegian club Molde on 8 August, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute.[43] He made his league debut on 12 August against Thun, playing the full match</p>						  
							  	<p>Chelsea<br>
									2013-14: Entry into first-team squad<br>
									On 23 January 2014, Chelsea announced that a deal had been agreed with Basel to sign Salah for a fee reported to be in the region of £11 million.[62] Three days later the transfer was completed, making him the first Egyptian to sign for the London-based club.[63] Liverpool had been keen to sign the Basel striker, and had made an offer of £11 million but were beaten to his signature by the Blues.
								</p>
							  	<p>Roma<br>
									2016-17: Permanent transfer, Serie A runner-up<br>
									On 3 August 2016, Roma announced the signing of Salah on a permanent deal for €15 million.[103][104] He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–0 win over Udinese in the opening game of the season on 20 August.[105] On 6 November, Salah scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Bologna, his first club career hat-trick.[106] However, a ruptured ankle ligament kept him out for the first half of December.[107] He returned as a half-time substitute in a 1–0 defeat against title rivals Juventus on 17 December.[108] Salah then endured a two-month period without a goal, he broke his drought on 19 February, scoring against Torino in a 4–1 win.[109] On 9 March, he scored Roma's opening goal in an eventual 4–2 defeat to Lyon in the first leg of the round of sixteen in the UEFA Europa League.[110] In spite of a 2–1 win in the second leg, they were unable to turn the tie around and were knocked out 5–4 and aggregate.[111] On 28 May, in the final game of the season, Salah was substituted for captain Francesco Totti, who was playing his final game with the club, in a 3–2 win over Genoa.[112][113] Roma finished the season in second, just four points behind champions Juventus.[114] Salah scored 19 goals in all competitions.
								</p>
								<p>Liverpool<br>
									2017-18: Record-breaking individual success<br>
									On 22 June 2017, Salah agreed a transfer to Liverpool. He signed a long-term contract with the Reds for an initial £36.5m fee that could rise to £43m.[116] The fee was a club record, eclipsing the £35m spent on Andy Carroll in 2011.[117] He was assigned the number 11 shirt previously worn by Roberto Firmino who instead switched to number 9.[118] He joined the club on 1 July upon the opening of the summer transfer window, becoming Liverpool's first Egyptian player.[119] He scored on his Premier League debut against Watford in a 3–3 draw on 12 August.[120] On 24 August, Salah scored his second goal for Liverpool, in a 2017–18 UEFA Champions League play-off round 4–2 win (6–3 agg) against Hoffenheim, his first goal at Anfield.[121] Three days later, Salah scored and assisted a goal in a 4–0 victory over Arsenal.[122] For his performances in August, Salah was awarded Player of the Month by Liverpool supporters.[123] On 17 October, Salah netted twice in a 7–0 Champions League win over Maribor, helping Liverpool to the joint-largest ever away win in the competition, and the largest away win by an English club.
